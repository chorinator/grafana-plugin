Tgres Grafana Plugin
====================

This is a Grafana plugin for Tgres. It is a nearly verbatim copy of
the Graphite plugin from the Grafana distribution, though it is
expected to diverge eventually.

Installation
------------

There are no external requirements, this is plain JavaScript, no
traspilation required. Just `git clone` it into `data/plugins/tgres`
or wherever your Grafana installation stores plugins, and possibly
restart Grafana and you should be good to go.
